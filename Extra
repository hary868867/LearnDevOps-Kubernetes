container run time means a software that can run containers ... kubernetes will talk to the container run time via CRI (container run time interface ) which is an API 

both the container run time and kubernetes need to implement CRI so that kubernetes can run containers in pods 

but docker cannot implement CRI ... so we need cri-dockerd ... from mirantis we installed all the necessary cri-dockerd 


the Container Runtime must be configured to load the CNI plugins required to implement the Kubernetes network model 

so what we need are plugins that can co-work with CNI which are called CNI plugins

docker 

cri-dockerd 

------------


sudo swapoff //  didnt find swaop off details in etc/fastab folder ... so we need to off that everytime we login 
port         //  need to allow ports in sg's after kubernetes installation
