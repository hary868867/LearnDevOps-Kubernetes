Kubernetes Helm 

what is Helm - Helm is a package manager for kubernetes 

--

installing the helm - all commands are in lab4_Helm_install of helm folder 

--

deleting helm after all done - helm uninstall command to uninstall the resources created by helm
                               then deleting the helm binary which we have installed 
							
--

helm2  - although the course is helm3 ... many use helm2, so colling wanna show us how to installer Helm2

         with Helm2, we need both helm and tiller ... tiller can automatically downloads by helm init command & tiller is a pod which runs in kube-system namespace 
         
		 uses of tiller .. dont know still 
		 
there is no tiller for helm3 ...if we need to use helm2 only, then tiller is needed

helm charts - helm chart is a package which contains many files to get the desired work we need 
              
			  helm chart can be compressed as an archive 
			  
so what are the general files that are present in Helm chart : chart.yml file which has info about that particular helm chart 
                                                               there will be template sub folder which contains resources files like pod.yml, service.yml, ingress.yml etc etc 
															   with in the templates sub-folder, there will be customizable templates with placeholders that are replaced by values using something using helper functions. 
															   
															   we can add dependencies in chart.yml file for Helm3, for Helm2.. we put them in a seperate file requirements.yml 
															   
															   there is also values.schema.json file 
															   
															   there can be testing folder which contains pod defnitions files that are used for testing
