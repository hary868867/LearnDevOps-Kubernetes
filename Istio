what is a service mesh - a service mesh is a communication platform between two software components running in distributed systems ( what is distributed systems ?? may be many different services involved to make an app run, thats why the word distributed may be, but thats the exact meaning, please know the exact one )
                         (eg:  lets say a web app is talking to database. In order to make use of the services from the database, the web application needs to know a bunch of stuff. It needs to know the address for the database so that it can reach it on the network. It needs to know when it tries to connect to the database, if it can't make that connection, should it time out and throw an error? If it's established a connection to the database, but one of the calls it makes fails, should it retry? How often should it retry? How long should it wait between retries? And then lastly, security. Should that communication be encrypted? And how can we make sure that the web application is allowed to talk to the database? Those concerns will all live in a mixture of configuration in the web application and in code in the client library for the database.)
